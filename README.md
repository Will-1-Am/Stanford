This repository is record of the cs193p course as presented by [Paul Hegarty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbtqIBpUG7g&list=PLpGHT1n4-mAtTj9oywMWoBx0dCGd51_yG&index=14).  You will find my own thoughts and explanations for various bits of code and everything has been tested personally.  I hope you find this as useful for your Swift coding journey as I have and I sincerely hope that Paul Hegarty is aware of the inspiration he has provided in making this course accessible to all.
